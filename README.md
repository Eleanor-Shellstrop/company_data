# Company Spreadsheets

by Anne Ensign

## About

This is a project for Code Louisville's Data Analysis Course 2. 

This repo demostrates my ability to work with data on an eningeering level and on an analyst level. 

**Spreadsheets**

Data was generated through [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com).

`original_csvs` folder contains the CSVs as originally uploaded. Any transformation will occur to the CSVs in the `csv` folder.
